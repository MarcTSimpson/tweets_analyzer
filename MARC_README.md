Why I went with the Twitter Project:

I went with a twitter analysis project because I wanted to learn more about the twitter API. I have never worked with this and I wanted to push myself and do something completely new. When I saw the project, I noticed the app did a lot of cool API calls like showing you when the user is most likely to post during the week/time of day, who the top mentions are, where is the user posting the tweets, the source of the tweets (iPhone/Android/other), etc., etc. Instead of fixing known issues, I wanted to add my own feature that would enhance the project. So, from the tweets gathered I decided I wanted to do sentiment analysis on the tweets to see if the user posts positive/negative/neutral tweets. Learning about the twitter API was an interesting, fun and challenging project. I think this project relates to the position I am applying for because I am working directly with data and gaining insight and value from that data.

Challenges:

I work in classified areas at Northrop Grumman and all work must be done on site. Due to work commitments I have had to spend extra time at work lately so setting up the environment for this open source project took a little more time than I would have liked. Like I said in the previous paragraph, this was all new technology to me so I did a lot of research and reading up on Twitter's API (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html) to understand how the previous code worked and how I would go about implementing my features.

Data Visualization:

Once I finished up with the sentiment analysis, I wanted to do some visualization with the data. However, based on the type of data a pie/bar chart would be most appropriate to show the percentages. I improvised and added another data point (this time focused on the data visualization aspect). I decided to collect the hashtags from the tweets and create a word cloud. I think data visualizations are crucial because if you can’t present data in a clear way, then the meaning of the data is lost.

Findings:

Here are my findings for when I run my program on Datalogue’s twitter:

Here is when I run it for Microsoft:
